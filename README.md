## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a Python script for installing custom configurations for the popular first-person shooter game Apex Legends. The script automates the process of installing three different configurations that can enhance your gameplay: Neo Strafe, 2 Directional Strafe, and Supergliding.

Neo Strafe config provides you with a more effective strafing technique, allowing you to move more quickly and unpredictably, making it harder for your opponents to hit you.

2 Directional Strafe config enhances your strafing by adding a second direction to your movement, making it more difficult for your enemies to predict your next move.

Supergliding config improves your movement while in the air, allowing you to glide for longer distances and reach previously unreachable places on the map.

By using this script, you can quickly and easily install any of these configurations, and start using them right away in Apex Legends. The script is easy to use, and comes with detailed instructions on how to run it on your system.

Note: This script is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apex Legends or its developers. It is a third-party tool created by fans of the game, and is provided as-is, without any warranties or guarantees. Use at your own risk.

Simply download the exe from the releases page or compile the python script yourself. Once you have the executable, run it and select your keybind and strafe of choice. Then, navigate to the <b>root</b> folder of your apex directory (where r5apex.exe is located) and select that. Press the install button. Add `+exec autoexec` to the launch options of your game and play!
